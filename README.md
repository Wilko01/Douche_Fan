# Fan bathroom
This ESP32 controls the fan of the badroom and is it also might look right and just because I can I added lights to the fan. The fan is an in-line fan, where the cover in the bathroom itself is just for providing a nice cover for the 120mm airgap.

## Description and operation instructions
The fan is turned on when a certain humidity is detected and turned off when it is below another humidity value. The fan is controlled via different levels where at lower humidity levels the fan runs at a lower speed and when the hunidity level is high the fan runs at a higher speed. The fan is also turned on when the temperature is very high. The logic is running on the ESP32, so even if HomeAssistant is down the fan operates independently. To be able to override the logic there is an override variable which enables remote control and bypasing the ESP32 fan control.
The LEDs are just for fun and can be controlled manually or like in my case via HomeAssistant where some logic is in NodeRed to control the LEDs.

 ## Technical description
The PWM fan is controlled via the PWM signal coming from the ESP32. The ESP32 is running ESPHOME and connected to Home Assistant. The sensor for the humidity is included in this module, the LEDs of the fan are connected to this ESP32, but they only can be contolled via Home Assistant and an external motio sensor.
The construction is made modular to enable easy printing and mounting. I used magnets to easily remove parts, not only for mounting, but also for cleaning. The fan fits a 120mm pipe.
